# AI Features Implementation Plan

This document outlines a step-by-step plan to fully implement the AI features that are currently stubbed out. It covers improvements to the underlying services as well as UI integrations. 

## Overview

The current implementation of AI features (highlighted in the AIAssistedEditorService and associated UI components) uses dummy data and simulated delays to mimic functionality. To complete these features, we need to integrate real-world services for video analysis, speech-to-text transcription, and AI-powered recommendations.

## Step-by-Step Plan

### 1. Requirements and Research
n- Define the requirements for the video analysis, editing commands, and content suggestions.
- Research available APIs and frameworks (e.g., Google Cloud Video Intelligence API, AWS Rekognition, or custom ML models) to perform video scene segmentation and analysis.
- Identify a reliable speech-to-text service (e.g., Google Speech-to-Text, IBM Watson, or other alternatives) for transcript generation.
- Explore language models (e.g., OpenAI GPT or similar models) for generating editing recommendations and content suggestions.

### 2. Updating AIAssistedEditorService

#### Analyze Video Content
n- Replace the dummy implementation in `analyzeVideoContent(videoURL:)` with a call to a real video analysis service.
- Process the API response to extract scenes, transcripts, and quality issues.
- Update the data model if necessary (e.g., refine the `Scene` model for richer data).

#### Generate Editing Recommendations
n- Update `generateEditingRecommendations(analysis:)` to leverage an AI/ML model or a language model that processes the analysis output and recommends editing actions.
- Consider more advanced logic to handle multiple quality issues and different types of suggestions.

#### Apply Editing Command
n- Extend `applyEditingCommand(command:on:)` to parse a wider range of commands.
- Develop a command parser (possibly using NLP or rule-based logic) to interpret commands like trimming, filtering, adding effects, and more.
- Map parsed commands to appropriate methods provided by `videoService`.

#### Get Content Suggestions
n- Enhance `getContentSuggestions(for:property:)` by integrating a text generation API.
- Use property details and video analysis data to generate personalized titles, descriptions, and recommended amenities.

### 3. Backend Service Integrations

- **Video Analysis API:** Integrate with a cloud API or a custom ML model to perform scene detection and quality analysis.
- **Speech-to-Text:** Implement real speech-to-text transcription to generate video transcripts.
- **AI Text Generation:** Integrate a language model API for creating content suggestions and expanding editing recommendations.

### 4. User Interface Enhancements

- Update UI components (e.g., `AIAssistedInteractiveEditingView` and `AIContentSuggestionView`) to support the richer functionality once backend services are in place.
- Add additional error handling and user feedback mechanisms to address delays or failed API calls.
- Consider features like loading indicators, retry options, and detailed error messages.

### 5. Testing and Quality Assurance

- Write unit tests and integration tests for the new service integrations.
- Create mock services to simulate API responses during UI tests.
- Perform user testing to ensure the UI provides a seamless and intuitive experience.

### 6. Deployment and Monitoring

- Deploy updated backend services and ensure they are scalable.
- Monitor API performance, error rates, and user feedback.
- Set up logging and monitoring to catch and resolve issues proactively.

### 7. Future Enhancements

- Consider adding more AI-assisted features like auto-cropping, advanced filter recommendations, or multi-language support for transcripts.
- Iterate on the command parsing logic to support more nuanced editing commands.
- Gather user feedback and usage analytics to further refine the AI features.

## Conclusion

This step-by-step plan provides a roadmap for replacing stubbed AI features with fully functional, production-ready services. Each step involves both backend integration and user interface refinement to deliver a robust, AI-powered video editing experience.
